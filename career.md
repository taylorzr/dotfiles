# Summary
=========
Hi, I'm a software engineer, mostly experienced with backend systems in Ruby, but also a bit of Python, Javascript, and Elixir. Dabbled with go, rust, and a variety of other languages. Worked with systems on both Heroku and AWS, notably building a task-runner backed by AWS Batch.

Looking for the next step in my career, I'd probably be most effective in ruby, but would love to get some more experience in a typed, compiled language like Go. Open to working from downtown Chicago, western Chicago suburbs (live in Westmont), or would consider relocation.
